# Ceirop Beta 0.1
A program kinda like JRE, but for interpreting .crp files.<br>
It's designed to be portable, hence the name ceirop (just google ceirop and you'll get my point).<br>
As in the word CEIROP there are many (hidden) words, this CEIROP ports to many platforms (not yet)
<h3>Supported platforms:</h3>

 - Windows
 - Linux
 - MacOS
 <h4>Ceirop can be very easilly ported to any platform that supports C, SDL2, CURL and RAUDIO!</h4>
<h3>Dependencies:</h3>

 - SDL2 for graphics
 - CURL for networking
 - RAUDIO for audio
<h2>More coming soon!</h2>
